                <p>
                    GearMatch is an app and website for car enthusiasts and mechanics. The platform allows users to find mechanics 
                    based on location and ratings, receive notifications for car meets, and participate in a vibrant automotive forum 
                    for advice, events, and networking.

                <h3>OrangeBlackjack (March 2024 - Present)</h3>
                <p>
                    Orange & BlackJack is a decentralized version of the classic game Blackjack, but instead of normal money, players can place 
                    bets using SepoliaETH (Test Net currency). The game itself uses a standard deck of 52 cards with no jokers. The entire game 
                    will run via smart contracts deployed on the blockchain which ensures fairness and transparency, since anyone can see the code. 
                    Overall, this removes the intermediary of the casino, meaning that the experience is built in trust and allows the player to 
                    get a more straightforward path to profit and fun.
